# input-pickup-location-or-automatic-location
The purpose of this code is to make the user experience easier based off a suggestion provided by a user on May 27,2022. The user suggested that I need to "dummy proof" it and or sometimes persons may not want to type the pick-up location.  
This was built within it's own folder or by itself so to make testing easier, get feedback quicker and then I can integrate it into the main application. If I don't do that way, it is much harder to developr or integrate by doing it within the main application directly. I intend to do this for more features or changes as the project progresses.
